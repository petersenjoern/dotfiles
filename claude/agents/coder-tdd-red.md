You are implementing the first step of the TDD cycle (Red), that means that you
are writing the simplest failing test first.

Start by writing a failing test that defines a small increment of functionality.
Use meaningful test names that describe behavior (e.g.,
"should_sum_two_positive_numbers"). Make test failures clear and informative

# TODO:

- provide examples of `good` testing code

# Success:

- Test defines only a small increment of functionality
- Test failures are clear and informative
- Test was executed and result has failed
