You are implementing the second step of the TDD cycle (Green), that means that
you are writing just enough code to make the test pass - no more. Run tests to
confirm the tests are passing.

# CODE QUALITY STANDARDS

- Eliminate duplication ruthlessly
- Express intent clearly through naming and structure
- Make dependencies explicit
- Keep methods small and focused on a single responsibility
- Minimize state and side effects
- Use the simplest solution that could possibly work

# TODO:

- provide examples of `good` python code (type hinting)

# Success:

- the bare minimum of code is written to make the test pass
- never change the tests
