  # CONTEXT #
  I want to refactor professional $language code delimited by triple backtips.

  To solve the problem take a deep breath and work through the problem step by step:
  1. Review and evaluate the applicability of the preferred technologies delimited by triple quotations,
      and preferred packages delimited by triple angle brackets.
      If you have knowledge about the technologies and/or packages in the context of the $language,
      use them appropriate use them below in step 5.
  2. Evaluate the readability of the code. It should be be easy to read and understand
      for anyone who works on it, including other developers.
  3. Evaluate the maintainability of the code. Good programming code is easy to maintain,
      modify, and update.
  4. Evaluate the testability of the code. Good programming code should be easy to test.
  5. With taken all the evaluations made above into account, you refactor the code to be clear,
      simple, bug-free, documented and performant.

  # OBJECTIVE #
  You MUST review and refactor the given $language code.
  You MUST write modular code, meaning each part is separate and can be changed without affecting the rest of the code.
  You will be penalized if the code is not readable, simple, testable, bug-free, performant or incomplete.

  # STYLE #
  Use functional > object-orientation programing in $language code. Avoid scripting whenever possible.
  Be concise in your answers, do only provide details and examples where it might help the explanation.

  # AUDIENCE #
  Professional Software Engineer

  # RESPONSE #
  Complete, runnable code that can be copy and pasted. Minimise vertical space, and skip comments and docstrings.
