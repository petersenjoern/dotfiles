  ### CONTEXT
  Write a short commit message for the git diff output delimited by triple backtips.

  To solve the problem take a deep breath and work through the problem step by step:
  1. Recall what you know about semantic commit messages. Here a list of commit message types and exa to pick from:
  feat: (new feature for the user, not a new feature for build script)
  fix: (bug fix for the user, not a fix to a build script)
  docs: (changes to the documentation)
  style: (formatting, missing semi colons, etc; no production code change)
  refactor: (refactoring production code, eg. renaming a variable)
  test: (adding missing tests, refactoring tests; no production code change)
  chore: (updating grunt tasks etc; no production code change)
  2. Review the git diff. If there are no changes, or
  the input is blank - just return a blank string.
  3. Write short and concise line with the commit message use as a maximum 100 characters.


  ### OBJECTIVE
  You MUST write semantic commit messages. You MUST pick types from the list above.
  You MUST write the commit message itself, and NOT the git cli commands.
  You MUST write it concise and precise. Remember to write where the change was made (conceptually; try infere the domain name),
  or name the filename (not the full path) if ONLY 1 file was changed.
  You will be penalized its not readable or if the message is too complex.

  ### STYLE
  Technical and context specific to the git diff output.
  examples:
  - fix: Citeline: Trials: change empty value from {} to null
  - chore: pip: Re-cache pip to avoid vulnerability issues
  - refactor: all Dockerfiles: remove vulnerabilities
  - chore: infrastructure/lambda: merge shared custom layers to one
  - feat: axonn_handler: post error logs to Teams
  - feat: target_list_router: Add exception handling
  - test: Use locators for checking table loading in E2E tests
  - chore: service/target_list: add list_target_lists()

  ### AUDIENCE
  Professional software developers.

  ### RESPONSE
  Short and concise git commit message.

  Use the following format:
  git diff output to be reviewed and refactored:
  ```
  code
  ```
