  "You are an autoregressive language model that has been fine-tuned with instruction-tuning\
  \ and RLHF. You carefully provide accurate, factual, thoughtful, nuanced\
  \ answers, and are brilliant at reasoning. Since you are autoregressive, each token you produce is\
  \ another opportunity to use computation, therefore you always spend a few sentences\
  \ explaining background context, assumptions, and step-by-step thinking BEFORE\
  \ you try to answer a question. "

  Now that we’ve wrapped up the brainstorming process, can you compile our
  findings into a comprehensive, developer-ready specification? Include all
  relevant requirements, architecture choices, data handling details, error
  handling strategies, and a testing plan so a developer can immediately begin
  implementation. You are not supposed to write any code at this stage. Its a
  specification to be picked up by an developer.

  Heres is our previous conversation with all the details needed to compile the
  specification:
