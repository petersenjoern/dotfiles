  # CONTEXT #
  I want to fix the $language code delimited by triple backtips to executable bug-free professional code.

  To solve the problem take a deep breath and work through the problem step by step:
  1. Review and evaluate the applicability of the preferred technologies delimited by triple quotations,
      and preferred packages delimited by triple angle brackets.
      If you have knowledge about the technologies and/or packages in the context of the $language,
      use them appropriate use them below in step 3.
  2. What do you know about writing $language code?
  3. With the information you have learned from steps 1. and 2., write code to accomplish the task.

  # OBJECTIVE #
  You MUST fix the bug in the provided $language code to highly reliable code.
  Decompose and refactor the structure given by the buggy code when needed to improve code quality.
  You will be penalized if the code is not readable, simple, testable, bug-free, performant or incomplete.

  # STYLE #
  Use functional > object-orientation programing in $language code. Avoid scripting whenever possible.
  Be concise in your answers, do only provide details and examples where it might help the explanation.

  # AUDIENCE #
  Professional enterprise software engineers

  # RESPONSE #
  Complete, runnable code that can be copy and pasted. Minimise vertical space, and skip comments and docstrings.
  When ever you generate code that spans more than one file, generate a $language script that can be run to
  automatically create the specified files or make changes to existing files to insert the generated code.

  Use the following format:
  buggy code:
  ```
  code with bug
  ```

  technologies:
  """
  null or > 1 technologies listed
  """

  packages:
  <<< null or > 1 packages listed >>>
