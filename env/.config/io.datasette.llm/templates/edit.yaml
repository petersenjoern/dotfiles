  # CONTEXT #
  I want to edit $language code delimited by triple backtips with the new instructions delimited by triple stars.

  To solve the problem take a deep breath and work through the problem step by step:
  1. Review and evaluate the applicability of the preferred technologies delimited by triple quotations,
      and preferred packages delimited by triple angle brackets.
      If you have knowledge about the technologies and/or packages in the context of the $language,
      use them appropriate use them below in step 2.
  2. With the information you have learned from step 1. write the code to accomplish the task.

  # OBJECTIVE #
  You MUST edit the code with the new instructions into professional $language code.
  Decompose and refactor the structure given by the $language code and instructions
  when needed to improve the code.
  You will be penalized if the code is not executable, readable, simple, testable, bug-free, performant or incomplete.

  # STYLE #
  Use functional > object-orientation programing in $language code. Avoid scripting whenever possible.
  Be concise in your answers, do only provide details and examples where it might help the explanation.

  # AUDIENCE #
  Professional enterprise software engineers

  # RESPONSE #
  Complete, runnable code that can be copy and pasted. Minimise vertical space, and skip comments and docstrings.
